# Classifier Analysis Application

### Student: Cian Manley
### Supervisor: Mark Roantree

### Purpose of the project?

What I aim to achieve with this project is a functional web application to help compare different algorithms used on a upload dataset. This will help end-users to by saving time on choosing which algorithm may suit their dataset. It will be based around a number of different algorithms. A user will be able to compare each of the algorithms on a simple UI created in react. 

### Added information

I will be using the anaconda toolkit to develop the backend of the project. I will be using react to develop a single page web app in order to keep the simple UI for users to read.
